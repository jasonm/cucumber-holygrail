OK @jayunit and @bcardarella are hacking on mynyml-holygrail to see if that'll work in Cucumber since
mynymyl did the badassery of making javascript testing work in rails integration tests.

Nota bene all up on the config/environment.rb because there's a gem dependency on a nonexistent gem
(you'll want to build the holygrail gem from scratch, and hack the gemspec to call the version 0.5.1.integration):

    # Gem built from feature branch: http://github.com/mynyml/holygrail/tree/integration_tests
    config.gem 'holygrail', :version => '0.5.1.integration'
